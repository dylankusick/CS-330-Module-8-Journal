Includes the files necessary to produce a 3D gym scene


    How do I approach designing software?
        What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
I have learned how to add shapes and lighting to a 3D environment. To make the scene more realistic I was also able to add textures to the different objects that I made. 
        
        What design process did you follow for your project work?
The design process took a lot of learning, implementing, fixing, and reworking. The process made me take one step forward, and two steps back at some points due to the content being relatively new. Learning new skills every week allowed me to constantly progress and make the scene more and more realistic. The process took time but taking small steps was the way to go.
        
        How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I could use the design approach in the future by tackling new concepts in small chunks rather than large ones. These tactics will be helpful not just in design, but all areas of software development. 

        
    How do I approach developing programs?
        What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
As I mentioned before, taking small steps and constantly building on this project was something new to me. Oftentimes when faced with larger projects I take them head on towards the due date. Due to the nature and difficulty of the coursework, taking the bite-sized chunks was necessary.
        
        How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was necessary for this project. We were able to work on two different "projects" every week. One of the projects was our final and the other was a new weekly concept. Doing this every week made the concepts easier to learn. The best way to learn something is to do it over and over until you really understand it.
        
        How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
I was able to approach developing code in a way similar to the way I usually do. The approach needed to be modified in order to complete this particular project because of how big it was. I was able to learn new concepts, then directly apply those concepts to this gym scene. Oftentimes in classes, we learn new concepts, but not as quickly, and we do not learn as many. 

        
    How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
        How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Computational graphics will further allow me to work on scenes that are three-dimensional should this be a necessary skill in future classes. But like many of the skills we learn in computer science, it is just one of the many skills I will be able to apply in future classes should we be dealing with graphics and visuals. Overall, working with code in different ways is what is strengthening my abilities over time, so I will constantly be improving for the next challenges I face in my classes.
        
        How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

Computational graphics and visualizations gave me another skill that I can apply in future jobs. If I decide to go on more of a design route these skills will apply directly. Overall, the way we worked with different files and learned how to combine different pieces of code to make the 3D scene was the most beneficial in my opinion. My future career may need me to work with different 3D meshes in order to complete a project, so I will have some experience in that area when I get to that point. It will be super beneficial for me to use these skills to build on something for a personal portfolio.
